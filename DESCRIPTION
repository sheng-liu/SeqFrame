Description: SeqFrame is essentially a flowFrame class added a data.frame
    describing the corresponding genomic annotation of channels. It provides
    facilities for convert essentially any spead sheet data (csv, table,
    data.frame, bigWig, bed) into SeqFrame, so facilitate user to easy access
    to the full functionality of flow cytometry packages such as flowCore and
    flowViz. and then use visualize it with rtracklayer.
